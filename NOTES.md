[release] RyukGram v1.4.0

Updated for Instagram 446.0.0.

### ✨ Highlights
- **Setting profiles.** Keep several complete setups under names and switch between them in a tap. Give each one a color and icon, duplicate it, share it as a file, or tie it to an Instagram account so it follows your quick switch
- **MobileConfig browser.** Read and change Instagram's own internal settings from inside the app, with search, copiable details, and export or import of everything you changed
- **Story stats.** Overview numbers over your archive, a views-per-story chart, and a searchable audience list you can filter, sort and pin. Tap anyone to see every story of yours they watched and how they reacted
- **Custom fonts.** Import your own .ttf or .otf files or download from thousands online, then use them across Instagram, RyukGram, or the story text tool
- **Full-resolution photos.** Photos download at their original upload size, often far larger than the copy Instagram hands the app, with a picker showing dimensions, format and file size per option
- **Post and Reel buttons.** Reorder Instagram's own like, comment, share, repost and save buttons, hide any of them, or drop a count without hiding its button
- **View-once media while closed.** Catch disappearing DM media that arrives while Instagram is fully shut, and keep it in the log when it gets unsent
- **Update checker.** RyukGram tells you when a newer release is out, shows what changed, and keeps every past release on its own page under About

### 🆕 New features

#### Setting profiles

- Reset a profile to defaults or turn everything off inside it, with a count of what is on and what differs
- Importing a backup can send its settings to a new profile instead of the ones you are using
- Backup & Restore is now Backup & Profiles, with a profile shortcut on the settings home page

- Buttons placed next to each other close the gap when one of them is hidden, with a switch to turn it off

#### Feed and reels
- New Post buttons and Reel buttons pages to reorder Instagram's own like, comment, share, repost and save buttons, hide any of them, or drop a count without hiding its button
